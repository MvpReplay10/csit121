<h2>Reflection</h2>
<p>
    This tier list is created in groups in order of S,A,B,C,D. Seperated into 6 sub groups of Tier, Food, Origin, Image, Taste, and Average Price. All food tier ratings are personal opinion. Tier list and contact html are two seperate pages suported with a navigation bar. Both pages are linked to one styling sheet to insure reflective styling on both pages. Two image are included based on the file name steak.jpg and burger.jpg. Both images are sourced via random Google Image search. Contact page is included where the user can send us there review and personal opinion on the tier list. Sources I used to help do this assignment is the previous two class recordings regarding making tables and a contact page. As well using previous graded assignments for refreshers as well with google for symbols and terms I seen in our class that I wasn't too familiar with. One thing that I am struggling with is making the outter back ground colors to match there row. For example S tier will be red, A tier will be purple, and so on. Like the example provided on brightspace.
