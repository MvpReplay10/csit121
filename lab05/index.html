    <p><i>Published on February 12,2025 by Daniel Kogan</i></p>
    <p>This is my first ever webpage. Building a HTML isn't as confusing as I thought it would be. Everything is broken down as you make the page. Starting with the headers and leading into the paragraph. The main struggle when creating the page is simply underestand the abreviations and meaning of what commands can cause certain actions. I learned alot from this content and assignment. To list a few would be understanding the difference between the header and paragraph. As well with know how to make words bold or slanted. A lot can be done to a webpage jsut takes knowing how to do it and doing the right steps.</p>

    <h3><strong>What I Learned</strong></h3> 
   <ol>
    <li>To make ordered and un ordered lists.</li>
    <li>Make letters bold or slanted.</li>
    <li>Understand how to create a header and a paragraph</li>
   </ol>
   <p>To help better understand this assigment and HTML I used the following 2 websites.</p>
   <ul>
    <li><a href="https://gw3schools.com">W3Schools.com</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://google.com">Google.com</a></li>

        <h2>Lab 03</h2>
        <p><i>Published on 19 Feb, 2025 by Daniel Kogan</i></p>
        <p>This week we learned about CSS. CSS is a style sheet layout that is used to create different fonts, background colors, add images, sections, and so much more. In this assignment I used 2 class selectors and 1 ID selector. One thing I would like to learn is how to fill in the empty spots that are in Lab 01 and Lab 03. Those are the only 2 that have that since I used a class selector. Another thing I wanted to learn was how to only cover certain words with a background color. My header has a background color going straight across but I only want it covering "Learning Web Standards". This assignment was at first confusing but after rewatching the class and being hands on I started to get a hang of it. Another thing that helped is the example of what our html should look like image that was posted after class on Feb 19, 2025. It gave me a sense of relief that my code matched up with what it was supposed to look like. As well helped me with mistakes I unfortunately did have from Lab 02.  </p>

        <h2>Lab 05</h2>
        <p><i>Published on March 19, 2025 by Daniel Kogan</i></p>
        <p>In this Lab we learned how to make a website viewable on both desktop and tablet. We do that by incorperating the flex tab which automatically notices the size of the users screens and adjust as needed.Each group is a different lab seperated into two colums when on and tablet device and three columns when on a desktop. What helped me do this assignment is the example that was given to us in class to create the style and display for different devices. I am still struggling and understand how this works and believe something is missing.*note- this style example was given in class. Several things have been adjust such as borders, padding, color and font. The way my site is designed fills in more of the space for desktop users and nicely orders it into single colums when used on a phone.
