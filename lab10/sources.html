    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <p>In this Lab we were required to pick one web standard of our choice off the list provided. The web standard I chose was Web Share API. This lab requires 4 html pages which I have seperated between importance,index,sources, and usage.html. The site is supported by one css file to insure same page style is used on all 4 pages. Each html has a nav link with a nav selection at the top of page. One background image is added into the css page that is displayed through out the 4 pages. The lab contains 3 sources in APA style listed on sources page. In this lab I didnt specifically learn anything new, just implemented knowledge used from previous labs such as Lab08 using images and adding links.  </p>
