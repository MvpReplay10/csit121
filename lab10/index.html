      <h1>What is the Web Share API?</h1>
      <p>Web Share API allows websites to integrate sharing capabilities for user's device, such as sharing links, text, or files via apps like Messages, Email, or social media. It can only be used on sites accessed via HTTPS. All browsers have a set of built-in Web APIs to make accessing data for complex operations. Third party APIs are not built into your browser, to use the API you will need to download the code from the web. For example Youtube API allows you to display videos on a website.</p>
