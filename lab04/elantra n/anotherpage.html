        <h2>Aftermarket Support</h2>
        <h3>What Can Be Done?</h3>
        <p>The aftermarket support have grown tremendously for the Hyundai Elantra N. Due to the model being out since 2021 alot of parts are now more easily available. Due to this there as well has been much trial and error in order to get the most performance and asthetic out of this car. As a person who had this car, one of my favorite things to do was install new aftermarket parts on my car and experience the affect it makes. One of the few things that I did was adding a air intake to help the my turbo get more air, as well making it able to hear the turbo sound outside of the car. Another thing I did was made my exhaust louder. As I did mention earlier the Elantra N already comes with a phenominal exhaust but I did want to make the popping sounds louder and more aggressive. With the aftermarket support for this vehicel you can achieve suprising stats that cars tripple it's price could not.</p>

        <h3>Reflection</h3>
        <p>In this assignment I learned how to incorperate images into my website. This task was a bit confusing at first but after watching class videos back I began to find it very easy. One thing I would want to learn is how I can place an image specifically where I would want it to be. For example on page two I wanted to add a horizontal photo but couldnt find a good place to put it without making the page look bad, resulting in me using a different photo. This assignment was fun as the images where optional so I got to do something I was interested in. Felt less like a homework asssignment!</p>
