        <h2>The Search</h2>
        <h3>My Future Purchase</h3>
        <p>I am currently in search of a brand new car I want to purchase. The 2025 Hyundai Elatra N game me an insterest. This car is not only traack ready but it also can be purshed for under 40k dollars. Even better Hyundai gives all fist car owners 10 years or 100,000 miles warranty. This is unbeatable with the warranty and car price better than any other competing brand. In 2024 Hyundai released the new and improved face lift changing the front appearance of all Elantras. Included in the imporvements are tires that each weight 8 pounds less, an imporved chasis, imporved and smoother suspension, improved breaks, and all chromo logs are now black.  </p>

        <h3>Comparing The Price of New and Used</h3>
        <p>In this topic we are not comparing the price of a used 2025 to a new 2025 Elantra N. But more so on the 2025 compared to the 2023 prior to the face lift. As some may assume since the brand new Elantra N has all these improvements it should cost significally more than a 2023 Elantra N. When we look at the listings of a brand new Elantra N it can be purshed for a total fo $37,800 on the road after all taxes and fees. Compared to a 2023 used Elanra N with around 15k miles, it would cost roughly $33,000. Sure you may save $4,800 but you no longer have all the warranties and improvemetns that the 2025 model recieved. At this points the decision falls on if it's worth it and if I like the improvements that were given, which i do and if I want to spend the extra several thousand.</p>
