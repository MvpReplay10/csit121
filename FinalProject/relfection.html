      <h1>Lessons Learned</h1>
      <p>This project gave me an opportunity to reflect on my progress throughout the semester in CSIT121. I faced some initial challenges with layouts and validating HTML, but I gradually developed a solid understanding of the structure and styling techniques. Building a portfolio site put everything together into a consistent design.</p>

      <p>Testing on multiple browsers and a mobile device revealed layout shifts that I corrected using media queries. I am still struggling with understanind how to use media querie. I believe I used it correctly but when I open the site on my phone the images and text doesn't fit the layout correctly. It made me more thoughtful about spacing, font sizes, and navigation patterns.</p>

      <p>Overall, the course taught me the foundations of HTML and CSS, including structural elements, tables, and responsive design. My portfolio is a reflection of those labs and my progress in this semester. I learned alot in this semester and enjoyed many of the assingments giving me the ability to make the website however I want as long as it meets requirements. I still have alot of practice and skills to work on. </p>
