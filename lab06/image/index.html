   <h3><strong>Design and Site Effeciency</strong></h3> 
   <ol>
    <li>This site uses all CRAP Design Principles. One to me that stands out the most is contrast. This website has a very simple and clean design with colors that represent the uniform. The colors are not to bright making the text, links, and images easy to view. Another thing I noticed is how much space there is between different sections. Making the page way less clustered then most.</li>
    <li>This site is very effective. Me personally as someone who has served in active duty in the Army. This was the webpage I used in order to research hundred's of jobs, schools, bonuses, and places all over the world I can go. This webpage can as well help the user gain access to his/her nearest recruiter in there area. This site provides quick and easy access to alot of information to someone interested in joining giving great site effectiveness and efficiency. </li>
   </ol>
   <p>Audit score for GoArmy.com is 95%!</p>

        <h2>Prefrence and Recommendation</h2>
        <p>This site is engaging with many link and pages that can lead to continues information as well with a search bar at the top right. The site is very easy to use and doesnt have un necessary pop ups and ads. This site is perfect for the targeted audience with proper CRAP design principles making it proffessional and appropiate, being the US Army webpage. One thing that I did have to do as a user of this webpage was whenever I wanted to get more information or videos about certain jobs I would often resort to youtube or google. This page will show all the jobs, descriptions, and oppurtunities but for more in depth information I would have to go to other sites. One thing I would recommend this site to add is more in depth information or trusted sources that may lead to more information about certain jobs or trainings.</p>
